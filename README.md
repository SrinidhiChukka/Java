Baasic Java Calculator


This is my basic Java Calculator, designed to be more than just a simple arithmetic tool. I built it to demonstrate clean coding, practical Java skills, and attention to detail—all while keeping it interactive and user-friendly.  

Whether you’re doing quick calculations, testing edge cases, or just exploring features, this calculator is built to work reliably and elegantly.

 Key Features 
1. Comprehensive Math Operations
Basic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
Advanced: Power (x^y), Square Root, Modulus (%)  
Flexible Input: Addition & Multiplication can handle 2 or 3 numbers thanks to method overloading  

2. User-Friendly Interface
Menu-driven design: Clear, numbered options that make navigation intuitive
Color-coded output: Results, prompts, and errors are easily distinguishable  
History tracking:Stores the last 10 calculations with timestamps, so you never lose track  

3. Robust & Reliable
- Handles divide-by-zero errors gracefully  
- Rejects invalid inputs and prompts the user to enter valid numbers  
- Avoids negative square root errors with informative messages  

4. Professional Coding Practices
- Uses ArrayList for dynamic storage of calculation history  
- Implements method overloading to showcase advanced Java concepts  
- Organized, modular, and reusable code structure
