STUDENT RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
A simple Java-based console application to manage student records efficiently.  
This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student data using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

OVERVIEW:
Managing student records manually can be tedious and error-prone.  
This application provides an interactive console interface where you can:

- Add new students
- View all students
- Update student details
- Delete student records
- Search for a student by ID

The program uses a dynamic ArrayList to store student objects, making it easy to manage and update data.

FEATURES:

1. Add Student
   - Enter a unique ID, name, and marks.
   - Prevents adding duplicate IDs.

2. View Students
   - Displays all students in a clean, tabular format.

3. Update Student
   - Update a studentâ€™s name or marks by providing their ID.

4. Delete Student
   - Remove a student from the record by ID.

5. Search Student
   - Search for a specific student by their ID.

6. Input Validation
   - Handles invalid inputs gracefully, preventing crashes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Any code editor or IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.)
