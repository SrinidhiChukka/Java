ADAPTIVE ONLINE QUIZ APP:

Project Overview:
The Adaptive Online Quiz App is a console-based Java application designed to provide an engaging and interactive quiz experience.
Unlike traditional quizzes, this app adjusts the difficulty level of questions based on the user’s performance.
Correct answers lead to harder questions.
Incorrect answers lead to easier questions.
This project demonstrates core Java concepts, object-oriented programming (OOP), control flow, and logical problem-solving, making it a strong addition to any portfolio for recruiters.

Key Features:
Adaptive Difficulty: Questions automatically become easier or harder depending on the user’s answers.
Score Tracking: Users earn points for correct answers, and a final score is displayed at the end.
Performance Summary: A clear summary showing the user’s total score and progress.
Topic-Based Questions (Optional): Can be extended to include multiple topics like Java, Math, or General Knowledge.
Interactive Console: Menu-driven input for an easy and intuitive experience.

Technologies Used:
Java – Core programming language
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Classes, objects, encapsulation
Collections – List for storing quiz questions and options
Control Flow – if-else statements and loops for quiz logic
Console I/O – Scanner for user input

Future Enhancements:
Include multiple topics and let the user choose one.
Add time tracking for each question.
Implement a leaderboard to save and display high scores.
Build a GUI interface using Java Swing or JavaFX for better user experience.
